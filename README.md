# STS-115-2021
This is an adaptation of prof. Lindsay Porier's STS115 lab workshops, made for the course as taught in winter 2021 by Alejandro PdL. This course introduces students to data science analysis, through practical engagement and critical reflection. Throughout the quarter, we will study different strategies for finding, analyzing, and presenting data in an accessible, reflexive, and compelling manner. We will also explore some of the cultural, political, and ethical challenges in contemporary data production and interpretation. The course will introduce elementary aspects of the R computing environment to explain some of its fundamental concepts. Previous expertise with R or computational statistical analysis is not a prerequisite.
